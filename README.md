# Large-Num-Calc
A Python based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on 
large numbers (size-wise) or really tiny valued decimal numbers that cause underflow

Currently supports 
  - Reading in decimal input as a string
  - Returning decimal output as a string
  - Performing addition of two numbers
  - Performing subtraction of two numbers
  - Performing multiplication of two numbers
  - performing quotient division of two numbers
  
I developed this script using the Python "Decimal Class" as a helper module for another project.
